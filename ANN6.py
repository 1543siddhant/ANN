# Write a python program to recognize the number 0, 1, 2, 39. A 5 * 3 matrix forms the numbers. For
# any valid point it is taken as 1 and invalid point it is taken as 0. The net has to be trained to recognize
# all the numbers and when the test data is given, the network has to recognize the particular numbers
